        <p>
          Input a number to determine if it is prime.<br>
        </p>

          The maximum input value before truncation error is 9007199254740991 (~9e15, nine and fifteen zeros!),
          which is not prime but has a relatively large least factor.
          This is because JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point numbers according to IEEE 754,
          and this number is the largest this format supports.

        <h2 class="themecolor"> FOOD REVIEWS </h2>
        <p> My goal is to objectively convey the flavors and textures I experience rather than try to generate some rating or ranking you probably wouldn't agree with. I suggest you use these reviews as data points and decide for yourself what sounds good or bad.

        <h2 class="themecolor"> UNCLE GIMPY'S INTELLECTIFIER (WALLET REFERENCE SHEET) </h2>
        <p>
          Here is an old reference sheet with simple formulae for length, area, volume as well as useful conversions.
          It's called Uncle Gimpy's Wallet Intellectifier, and is meant to be folded up and kept in a wallet or purse.
          This is certainly from a time before internet enabled personal devices (probably at least the 1980s), but these sorts of reference sheets are still just as useful today, if not less common. <br>
          It is mostly legible in its current state, but I intend to retype and upload a clean copy in the future.

        <p>
          On every refresh of this website the header color is changed
          according to the selection of a (pseudo)random number.
