&lt;p>After hundreds of thousands of years of the species &lt;em>homo sapiens&lt;/em>, it&amp;rsquo;s truly amazing to be the first person to achieve, create, or experience something.
Maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll create an algorithm or prove a theorem which will change the world.
Perhaps one day I&amp;rsquo;ll steal just a bit of knowledge from the gods, and then give it to the world.
However, Aug. 13, 2024 was not to be such a day for me, at least not as such.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Orthogonal projection onto an affine subspace</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/posts/affine_projection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 02:19:38 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/posts/affine_projection/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="orthogonal-projection-onto-an-affine-subspace">Orthogonal projection onto an affine subspace&lt;/h1>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Projection onto a vector subspace is a common task in linear algebra courses.
Affine subspaces, sets of the form
$
\{ \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^m : \exists \mathbf{c} :
 \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{Ac} &amp;#43; \mathbf{b} \}
$
for fixed matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and vector $\mathbf{b}$,
also have well-defined projections.
However, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find a direct proof for the expression giving the projection of a point onto an affine space:

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>An often stressed property of the conjugate gradient method (CG) for solving linear systems is the monotonic decrease in the A-norm of the error.
When CG is applied in practice the exact solution is unknown and the error cannot be computed or tracked, so the residual or relative residual is used instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the kinds of guarantees available for residuals are slightly weaker and more involved than is often presented in courses, due to complications introduced by different norms and arithmetic precisions.

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Recently I needed to solve the following problem: given a square matrix $\mathbf{A}$ find another square matrix $\mathbf{B}$ satisfying
$\text{vec}(\mathbf{A})^T \text{vec}(\mathbf{B}) = 0$.
This is the sense in which I use the word orthogonal here, rather than the columns of $\mathbf{A}$ or $\mathbf{B}$ being orthogonal.
Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible for the columns of a rank 1 matrix to be orthogonal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are like me this problem sounds: easy at first glance, then quite difficult, then easy again.
Here is my solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This website: thoughts and history</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/posts/this_website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 18:37:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/posts/this_website/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="this-website">This website&lt;/h1>

In the case at hand the answer was &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;, but I suspected there might be actually be a limit on nested parentheses depth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the following Python script (which leverages the ability of the interpreter to evaluate expressions at runtime via &lt;code>eval&lt;/code>), we can determine the answer is &lt;span class='themecolor'>200&lt;/span>.

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Here we are concerned with &amp;ldquo;non-negative&amp;rdquo; linear systems, that is, linear systems where $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{b} \geq \mathbf{0}$ (elementwise).
In particular, we give a sufficient condition for non-negativity of the solution $\mathbf{x}$ to $\mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b}$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we discuss an intuition for the result.
The columns of $\mathbf{A}$ form a linear cone; if a vector $\mathbf{c}$ (a right hand side to the linear system) is known to lie in the cone, then one can find a &amp;ldquo;subcone&amp;rdquo; containing $\mathbf{c}$.
The sufficient condition essentially upper bounds the &amp;ldquo;radius&amp;rdquo; of this subcone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The space of matrices where LU requires pivoting is almost full-dimensional</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/posts/dim_lu_pivot_needed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 19:19:38 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/posts/dim_lu_pivot_needed/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-space-of-matrices-requiring-pivoted-lu-factorization-is-almost-full-dimensional">The space of matrices requiring pivoted LU factorization is almost full-dimensional&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Eigenpairs of symmetric matrices are intimately related to optimization and critical points, with the eigenvectors being critical points of the Rayleigh quotient.
In optimization settings, the type of critical point (minimum, maximum, saddle point) is an important feature in designing and understanding algorithms.&lt;/p>

sauce is well distributed and in a good ratio with the other components.
Its flavor was light on spices and pleasantly acidic.
propietary blend of cheeses (equal parts monterey jack, mozzarella, white cheddar) and the carefully metered cook time means the cheese is both flavorful (properly browned) and tender (not overcooked).
This contributes to the overall &amp;ldquo;tender bite&amp;rdquo; of the pizza; that is to say the selected bite separates from the rest of the slice with no gnawing or vigorous head shaking.

&lt;p>&lt;span class="themecolor">Domino&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/span> pan pizza (top left) is appropriately doughy with a crisp bottom and a crust that was almost indiscernible from the rest of the pizza.
However, the bread/dough was alarmingly sweet as compared to the typical pizza experience.
The sauce was well distributed on the pizza, but the ratio of sauce to the rest of the pizza was too low.
However, it is perhaps important to note that I err on the side of more sauce when in doubt.
As for taste, the sauce was appropriately acidic, but perhaps under spiced.
Moving up to cheese, it was applied in the correct proportion all the way to the edges, where crisped cheese bits could be had.
Notably, Domino&amp;rsquo;s blend of mozzarella, monterey jack, and white cheddar provides a punchier flavor when compared to 100% mozzarella topped pizzas.

This is certainly from a time before internet enabled personal devices (probably at least the 1980s), but these sorts of reference sheets are still just as useful today, if not less common.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prime number detector</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/posts/prime_detector/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2020 18:37:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/posts/prime_detector/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="prime-number-detector">Prime Number Detector&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Input a number to determine if it is prime.&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;form id="primeform" onsubmit="determineIfPrime(); return false">
 &lt;input type="text" id="primeinput">
 &lt;input type="submit" class="button" id="primebutton" value="RUN">
&lt;/form>
&lt;p class="themecolor" id="primeresponse">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The maximum input value before truncation error is 9007199254740991 (~9e15, nine and fifteen zeros!),
which is not prime but has a relatively large least factor.
This is because JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point numbers according to IEEE 754, and this number is the largest this format supports.&lt;/p>

I also enjoyed implementing some tricks to accelerate the solution, the main one being the square root bound on the factors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Re() and Im() as complex numbers</title><link>https://ghbrown.net/posts/re_im_as_numbers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2019 18:37:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ghbrown.net/posts/re_im_as_numbers/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="re-and-im-as-complex-numbers">Re() and Im() as complex numbers&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Here are some projects I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="chapel">Chapel&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://chapel-lang.org/" target="_blank">Chapel programming language&lt;/a> is designed for parallel computing at scale.
I &lt;a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chapel" target="_blank">package&lt;/a> the compiler for Arch Linux, and have contributed multiple routines to built in modules like &lt;code>LinearAlgebra.chpl&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="fortran-lang">fortran-lang&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://fortran-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">fortran-lang&lt;/a> is a community effort to polish and modernize the Fortran programming language.
Efforts include a &lt;a href="https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/" target="_blank">package manager&lt;/a> and a &lt;a href="https://stdlib.fortran-lang.org/" target="_blank">standard library&lt;/a> (to which I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed routines for linear algebra).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="pyttb">pyttb&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sandialabs/pyttb" target="_blank">pyttb&lt;/a>, the &amp;ldquo;Python Tensor Toolbox&amp;rdquo; provides data structures and algorithms for tensor computations.
I contributed a visualizer and significantly accelerated another function.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="endeavouros">EndeavourOS&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed bug fixes to configurations for the &lt;a href="https://i3wm.org/i3" target="_blank">i3 window manager&lt;/a> version of the &lt;a href="https://endeavouros.com/" target="_blank">EndeavourOS&lt;/a> Linux distribution.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="beets">beets&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://beets.io/" target="_blank">beets&lt;/a> organizes local music collections, including autotagging and so much more.
I contributed an interface to match single tracks using Discogs.&lt;/li>
